# Java-Darts-Math

This is the first project I've written in Java. I've ported it over from a Python project I previously made.   

This is a command line game meant to help people practice the mental math necessary when playing
a game of Darts in a bar or elsewhere. Since my generation was raised using calculators,
I wanted to give people a fun way of practicing mental math on their own before they 
play Darts in public.    

To run the project, open it in Eclipse, right click on the DmInstruc.java file and hit
"Run as Java Application".

Features of this project include:  
1. User Input   
2. Storing the high scores in a JSON file  
3. Each high score is calculated by the time that it takes you to complete the game.  
4. Object Oriented Programming (although no inheritance within this program)  
5. Java Exceptions  
6. Dependencies/directory structure set up with Maven
